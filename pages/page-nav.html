    <p class="lyrics">
      [Verse 1]<br>
      Seasons change<br>
      And I've tried hard just to soften you<br>
      Well, seasons change<br>
      But I've grown tired trying to change for you<br>
      'Cause I've been waiting on you<br>
      I've been waiting on you<br>
      'Cause I've been waiting on you, ooh-ooh, ooh<br>
      I've been weighing on you<br>
      <br>
      [Chorus]<br>
      As it breaks<br>
      The summer will wake<br>
      But the winter will wash what is left of the taste<br>
      As it breaks<br>
      The summer will warm<br>
      But the winter will crave what has gone<br>
      Will crave what has all gone away<br>
      <br>
      [Verse 2]<br>
      People change<br>
      But you know some people never do<br>
      You know when people change<br>
      They gain a peace, but they lose one too<br>
      'Cause I've been hanging on you, ooh-ooh, ooh<br>
      I've been weighing on you<br>
      'Cause I've been waiting on you, ooh-ooh, ooh<br>
      I've been hanging on you<br>
      [Chorus]<br>
      As it breaks<br>
      The summer will wake<br>
      But the winter will wash what is left of the taste<br>
      As it breaks<br>
      The summer will warm<br>
      But the winter will crave what has gone<br>
      Will crave what has gone<br>
      Will crave what has all gone away<br>
      <br>
      [Outro]<br>
      'Cause I've been waiting on you<br>

    <p class="lyrics">
      [Verse 1]<br>
      In parting ways<br>
      And parting hearts<br>
      A dress of leaves blows to the winds<br>
      Take these sacrificial remnants—untended<br>
      Bashed to dust<br>
      And trust distressed<br>
      Red cheeks—caved in<br>
      <br>
      [Chorus]<br>
      I don't believe anymore<br>
      Don't believe anymore<br>
      Cuz all we know, is gone and cold<br>
      I don't believe anymore<br>
      Don't grieve anymore<br>
      Cuz all I hold, is all I own<br>
      <br>
      [Verse 2]<br>
      Is this a desperate wish for dying?<br>
      Or a wish that dying cease?<br>
      The fear that keeps me going and going and going<br>
      Is the same fear that brings me to my knees<br>
      [Chorus]<br>
      I don't believe anymore<br>
      Don't believe anymore<br>
      Cuz all we know, is gone and cold<br>
      I don't believe anymore<br>
      Don't grieve anymore<br>
      Cuz all I hold, is all I own<br>
      <br>
      [Verse 3]<br>
      I am the air, the after<br>
      Always in the clouds<br>
      Searching for some answer<br>
      Parted now, I am the shore—repeated<br>
      Becoming air<br>
      I'm finally free<br>
      <br>
      [Chorus]<br>
      I don't believe anymore<br>
      Don't believe anymore<br>
      Cuz all we know, is gone and cold<br>
      I don't believe anymore<br>
      Don't grieve anymore<br>
      Cuz all I hold, is all I own<br>

    <h3 class="lyrics" id="tower">The Tower</h3>
    <p class="lyrics">
      [Verse 1]<br>
      Threw a bottle<br>
      Across the water<br>
      To someone who's<br>
      Thinking of me<br>
      There's a tower<br>
      In the ocean<br>
      Pouring through me<br>
      That's my will and testament<br>
      <br>
      [Chorus]<br>
      I, I, I am waiting on the other side, sigh<br>
      Looked out into everything and<br>
      I lie, tell myself, "It's nothing", when it's quite right<br>
      Everything grows stronger in the light<br>
      <br>
      [Verse 2]<br>
      When a boy who<br>
      Played with razors<br>
      Met a girl who<br>
      Opened cages<br>
      All the birds flew<br>
      Through the graveyard<br>
      And their laughter<br>
      Was contagious<br>
      <br>
      [Chorus]<br>
      I, I, I am waiting on the other side, sigh<br>
      Looked out into everything and<br>
      I lie, tell myself, "It's nothing", when it's quite right<br>
      Everything grows stronger in the light<br>
      <br>
      [Post-Chorus]<br>
      In the light<br>
      In the light<br>
      In the light<br>
      <br>
      [Bridge]<br>
      Standing at the sea and swallowing<br>
      Without you, beside you<br>
      But you knew what I knew<br>
      [Chorus]<br>
      I, I, I am waiting on the other side, sigh<br>
      Looked out into everything and<br>
      I lie, tell myself, "It's nothing", when it's quite right<br>
      Everything grows stronger in the light<br>
