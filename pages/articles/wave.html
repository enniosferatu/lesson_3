    <p class="p-article">In July 2007, Future Islands recorded their debut album Wave Like Home with Chester Endersby
      Gwazda at Backdoor Skateshop in Greenville. As Cashion describes: "When we did Wave Like Home, we were
      working with a really tight schedule. Sam lived in Asheville and could only be in Greenville to record for a week
      or so, and we had to work very fast. We recorded the whole album in 3 days, and we spent about a month mixing it."
    </p>

    <p class="p-article">After a Halloween party in 2007, Erick Murillo quit the band. Having finished his degree,
      Cashion moved back to Raleigh: "We were scattered across North Carolina. I was living in Raleigh on friends'
      couches, Gerrit was in Greenville and Sam was in Asheville, which was five hours away." Between November 2007
      and June 2008, Future Islands—encouraged by Dan Deacon and Benny Boeldt from Baltimore band
      Adventure—relocated to Baltimore. Cashion moved in November, Herring in January and finally
      Welmers. There, they could have access to cheap rent, be part of a supportive community and be closer to
      cities like New York and Washington, which allowed them to tour more extensively.
    </p>

    <p class="p-article">During the first half of 2008, the band added another drummer, Sam Ortiz from the Baltimore
      band
      Thrust Lab, who left weeks before the start of their first national tour in late July. On August 5,
      2008, the band released the track "Follow You (Pangea Version)" as part of a split 7-inch with Deacon, through the
      label 307 Knox Records. Future Islands' track on the EP "Follow You (Pangea version)" was recorded in April
      2006 at the Bonque house in Greenville, North Carolina during the Pangea sessions: the band's first proper session
      with Chester Endersby Gwazda.

    <p class="p-article">London-based label Upset The Rhythm released Wave Like Home on August 25, 2008, which made
      sales
      difficult in the US due to the import costs. The cover art was designed by Kymia Nawabi, a former member of Art
      Lord & the Self-Portraits. She also designed the cover art of the Feathers and Hallways 7-inch which was
      recorded in Oakland, California, on July 21, 2008, during their first U.S. tour. Produced by Chester Endersby
      Gwazda, it was released on April 15, 2009, by Upset The Rhythm. This single was their first release as a focused
      three-piece: "We have definitely talked about adding a drummer at some point, when the time is right, but right
      now it just makes sense to be a three piece if, for nothing else, the fact that it is really easy to tour as a
      three piece. We really have very little gear. We really just have PA speakers for the keyboard and a bass amp."
