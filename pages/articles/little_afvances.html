    <p class="p-article">When Art Lord & the Self Portraits disbanded in late 2005, its members forgot they had
      discussed
      with alt-country band The Texas Governor the possibility of touring together. Future Islands was formed in
      early 2006 to keep that commitment, with an original line-up consisting of Cashion, Herring, Welmers and Erick
      Murillo—bassist for The Kickass—who played an electronic drum kit.

      Already as Art Lord & the Self-Portraits, the band wanted to change their image and took this opportunity to do
      so. William Cashion stated: "Me and Gerrit had been talking for a while about how we wanted to get rid of the
      gimmick. We wanted to be taken seriously. Our songs had outgrown the gimmick that the band was made on. The songs
      were starting to deal with bigger, personal, universal themes. We wanted to be taken seriously."
    </p>

    <p class="p-article">The band played their first show on February 12, 2006, at an anti-Valentine's Day party in a
      venue called the Turducken house, opening for about a dozen bands. After writing 6-7 songs in only one
      week, they had to come up with a new name quickly, narrowing it down to two choices—Future Shoes and Already
      Islands—and combining them into one. Future Islands self-released the EP Little Advances on April 28,
      2006, which they recorded in March 2006.

    <p class="p-article">A couple of months later, Herring dropped out of college and left Greenville to deal with a
      substance abuse problem he had acquired: "In June, I left town and didn't come back. It was just drug problems,
      man. I got sucked into the darkness of partying and shit college kids do. I came clean to my parents and said,
      'Look, I have a problem and need your help.' I stayed at my parent's for about a month and then moved across the
      state to Asheville, North Carolina. It took about a year for me to get my act together."
    </p>

    <p class="p-article">The band still continued and on January 6, 2007, they self-released a split CD with Welmers'
      solo
      project Moss of Aura, recorded in December 2006.
