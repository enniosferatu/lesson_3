    <p class="p-article">Sam Herring and Gerrit Welmers grew up in Morehead City, North Carolina, two streets away from
      each other, and attended the same middle school in Newport, North Carolina. They became friends around 1998,
      when they were in 8th grade. Herring had started making hip-hop music when he was 13 or 14, while Gerrit was a
      skater with interests in metal and punk music who bought his first guitar at age 14. Having different musical
      backgrounds, they did not consider making music together during high school. William Cashion started playing
      guitar when he was around 13, having had a couple of bands as a teenager in Raleigh, where he commuted to high
      school from Wendell, North Carolina. In 2002 he enrolled in the painting and drawing program at East
      Carolina University and had drawing classes with Sam Herring.The idea to form a band came while Cashion was
      helping Herring study for an art history exam. They invited local record shop personality Adam Beeby to
      play rhythmic keyboards and fellow art student Kymia Nawabi for percussion and backing vocals. After a
      tumultuous debut on Valentine's Day February 14, 2003, at Soccer Moms' House, Herring also invited Welmers
      to join the band. Only Cashion and Welmers already played a musical instrument—the guitar—but Cashion took
      the bass and Welmers the keyboards, for a Kraftwerk-inspired sound.

    <p class="p-article">Sam Herring played Locke Ernst-Frost, an arrogant narcissistic artist from Germany, Ohio,
      dressed
      in a
      70s-inspired white suit with slicked-back hair, and a heavy German accent. The character's name originally was
      meant to be Oarlock Ernest Frost but it got shortened as a reference to John Locke, the seventeenth-century
      philosopher; Max Ernst, the artist; and Robert Frost, the American poet.

    <p class="p-article">The band quickly gained a local reputation and started touring the underground venues in the
      Southeast,
      playing shows with North Carolina acts like Valient Thorr and Baltimore artists such as Height, Videohippos, OCDJ,
      Nuclear Power Pants, Santa Dads, Ecstatic Sunshine, Blood Baby, Ponytail and electronic musician Dan
      Deacon whom they met during a show on May 26, 2004.

    <p class="p-article">Nawabi who was already a senior when Cashion, Herring and Welmers were freshmen, left the band
      to
      prepare for her graduation project in June-July 2003. When Adam Beeby had to leave Greenville in September
      2005, the remaining members dissolved the band.
